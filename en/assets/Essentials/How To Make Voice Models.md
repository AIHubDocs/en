#### Lost in how to make an AI voice model? Here's how.

- To convert the the voice into your desired person, we'll use the best software for this, <U>**RVC**</u>.   

- RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) is an advanced AI voice cloning software. It's free & open-source.

- Requires **great <u>[specs</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#specs)** & <u>[GPU](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#gpu)</u> (specifically NVIDIA) to train effectively, but it can be executed through the <u>[cloud](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cloud-based)</u> & be used in any device.

Now let's begin with the steps. Keep in mind, it won't be an instant process, remember to be patient.

## Steps

### 1. Prepare dataset
- ***In the context of RVC***, the dataset is an **audio** file containing the **voice** the model will replicate. It can be either speaking or singing.

- For the best results, having a **clean** dataset is crucial, so take the time to remove any undesired noises.
       
- #### Learn more <u>[here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/datasets/).

### 2. Set up RVC
- With your dataset ready, it's time to set up RVC to train the model.   

- There are plenty of versions of RVC, but these are the best ones for beginners.      
Pick according to your needs:

    #### :icon-device-desktop: ‎ <u>[For local users](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/local/mainline/)</u>

    #### :icon-cloud: ‎ <u>[For cloud users](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/training/rvc-disconnected/)</u>

***
###### ‎ 
### 3. Train the model
- Before you start training, we inform you that the training guides are oriented around the use of <u>[TensorBoard](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/#tensorboard)</u>. Read about it & install it after setting up RVC.

- Now go & train your model. Good luck & be patient!
