### :icon-chevron-down:Cloud-based
- Any software or application that's stored, managed, and available through the provider's virtual servers, and is accessed through a web browser.        

- The opposite of <u>[local running</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#local-running).          
***
###### ‎       
### :icon-chevron-down:CUDA
- A technology developed by NVIDIA, that uses the power of graphics cards to perform calculations that require great processing power.    
- It's especially useful for AI tools, such as RVC and UVR, which greatly optimizes the process.       

- CUDA is downloaded automatically as a part of the NVIDIA driver.            
***
###### ‎       
### :icon-chevron-down:DAW
- It stands for **Digital Audio Workstation**, and it's any software used for making and mixing music.    

- For **basic** audio editing, we recommend <u>[Audacity</u>](https://www.audacityteam.org/).     
- For **professional** mixing, <u>[FL Studio</u>](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/).

***
###### ‎
### :icon-chevron-down:Google Colab
- Google Colaboratory is a product of Google that allows anybody to write & execute arbitrary python code through websites.     

- Cloud RVC users mainly use it for the RVC ports, like <u>[AICoverGen NO UI](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/aicovergen-no-ui/)</u>, <u>[Ilaria RVC</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/ilaria-rvc/), & <u>[RVC Disconnected</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/rvc-disconnected/).    

- It's free version is slower & with a usage limit of **4 hours per day**. When you ran out of it you'll have to wait 24 hours, or switch to another account.

- You can upgrade to a paid option for a better version too.

###### ‎       
### :icon-chevron-down:GPU
- It stands for Graphics Processing Unit. It's designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate creation of images.    

- In AI training, is used for quick parallel independent computations, which increases the speed substantially.     

- Basically the speed at which RVC/UVR will work will depend on how good your GPU is.       
               
***
###### ‎       
### :icon-chevron-down:Inference
- In the context of RVC, is the process where a voice model is used to transform an audio, to make it sound like the model.       
***
###### ‎       
### :icon-chevron-down:Local running
- Running locally is a process that involves running apps in your own machine, using its resources.
