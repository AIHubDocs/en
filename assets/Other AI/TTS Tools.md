## Introduction :icon-book:
***
- TTS is an abbreviation of Text To Speech, an AI that converts any given text into vocal speech.

- Some TTS make the speech from scratch, but others mentioned here are mixed with <u>[RVC](http://localhost:5000/en/essentials/whats-rvc/)</u>, converting audio to audio.

- but in some cases like Applio, it generates a TTS Audio of Edge TTS and then it changes the audio voice to the RVC model voice.

- Here's a list of some of the best TTS tools out there.
***
## ElevenLabs/11Labs
***
- <u>[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)</u> is a **freemium** (only one in this guide) service that offers TTS, training TTS models & translating videos from different languages.

***
## Bark TTS
***

- Bark is a **multilingual** TTS model created by Suno AI. It‚Äôs good at expressing **emotions** & non-speech sounds, such as laughter, laughs, sighs, music, gasps, clearing throat, hesitations ( - or ‚Ä¶ ), ‚ô™ for song lyrics, emphasis of words.
MAN/WOMAN: for bias towards speaker

- It can be used both <u>[locally](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#local-running)</u> or on the <u>[cloud](http://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#cloud-based)</u>:

## Edge TTS

- This is Microsoft Edge TTS, which is **good quality**, multilingual & works great on long sentences. It can be used only online (API):

  - Microsoft Edge:
  a. Download the Microsoft Edge Browser
  
  b. Open your Notepad
  
  c. Paste the following code:
  
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body style="background-color:#dddddd">

<h3 aria-hidden="true">Browser TTS "Hack"</h3>

<textarea rows="10" cols="50" id="ttsText" style="background-color:#eeeeee"></textarea>
<br />
<button aria-hidden="true" onclick="genText()"><font aria-hidden="true">Generate</font></button>

<pre id="tts"></pre>

<script>
function genText() {
  var x = document.getElementById("ttsText").value;
  document.getElementById("tts").innerHTML = x;
}
</script>



</body>
</html>
```

  d. Save it as ‚ÄúMicrosoft Edge TTS.txt‚Äù
  
  e. Rename the file to ‚ÄúMicrosoft Edge TTS.html‚Äù
  
  f. Open Microsoft Edge
  
  g. Drag the .html to it
  
  h. Write anything you want
  
  i. Use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) to record the audio, set the recording mode to loopback and it allows to record the internal audio (Realtek driver might be needed)
  
  j. Click Generate and then stop recording when the voice is done.
  
  k. After you click generate, you can also select Voice options in the toolbar and change the speed to a faster or slower speech pace.

## StyleTTS2
***
- StyleTTS 2 aims to achieve human-level TTS synthesis only in English, It works better on full sentences, both available locally and online.
It's possible to finetune on your own dataset.
It has 2 versions:
**LJSpeech** & **LibriTTS**.

**Key Difference:**

**LJSpeech**: The dataset consists of **single-speaker** recordings, making it suitable for training TTS models with a consistent voice.
**LibriTTS**: The dataset includes **multispeaker** recordings, allowing StyleTTS 2 to adapt to different voices.

**Locally**
- [Official StyleTTS2 Guide](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2)

**Online**
- [StyleTTS2 Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/styletts2/styletts2) (If you duplicate the space to skip queue, without GPU you can only inference)

## gTTS
***
**Google Text To Speech**, the same one used in Google Translator, it has **very few voices in different languages**, kinda **robotic** and doesn‚Äôt let you choose the gender of the voice, except in the colab version where i made a function to change the pitch of it, but it isn't that great. It can be used only online (API) :
