## Introduction :icon-book:
***
- TTS is an abbreviation of Text To Speech, an AI that converts any given text into vocal speech.

- The ones listed here offer a decent variety of features & options, such as <u>[model training](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#model-training)</u>, <u>[fine-tuning](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#fine-tuning)</u>, <u>[0 shot training](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#0-shot-training)</u>, or being <u>[mixed with RVC](https://ominous-waffle-r44vr6g95vvj2wqrx-5000.app.github.dev/other-ai/tts-tools/#rvc-forks)</u>.

- Here's an index of the best TTS tools out there:
***
## ElevenLabs/11Labs
***
- <u>[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)</u> is a **freemium** service (only one in this guide) that offers TTS, training TTS models & translating videos from different languages.

***
## Bark TTS
***

- Bark is a **multilingual** TTS model created by <u>[Suno AI](https://www.suno.ai/)</u>. 
- It‚Äôs characterized by its great ability to express **emotions** & non-speech sounds.
- Examples are laughter, laughs, sighs, gasps, clearing throat, hesitations ( - or ‚Ä¶ ), emphasis of words, etc.

- It can be used both <u>[locally](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#local-running)</u> or in the <u>[cloud](http://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#cloud-based)</u>:

  +++
***
## Edge TTS
***
- This is Microsoft Edge TTS, which is good **quality**, multilingual & works great on long sentences. 

- It can only be used online via their API, through their web browser, a HF/Colab space or **mixed with <u>[RVC](http://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/whats-rvc/)</u>**.

  +++ :icon-globe: ‚Äé BROWSER
  1. [Download the browser.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?ch=1&form=MA13FJ)
  
  2. Open your Notepad & paste the following code:
  
    ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <body style="background-color:#dddddd">

  <h3 aria-hidden="true">Browser TTS "Hack"</h3>

  <textarea rows="10" cols="50" id="ttsText" style="background-color:#eeeeee"></textarea>
  <br />
  <button aria-hidden="true" onclick="genText()"><font aria-hidden="true">Generate</font></button>

  <pre id="tts"></pre>

  <script>
  function genText() {
  var x = document.getElementById("ttsText").value;
  document.getElementById("tts").innerHTML = x;
  }
  </script>



  </body>
  </html>
  ```   
  ###### ‚Äé   
  3. Save it as ‚ÄúMicrosoft Edge TTS.txt‚Äù
  
  4. Rename it to ‚ÄúMicrosoft Edge TTS.html‚Äù
  
  5. Open Microsoft Edge & drag the .html to it.

  6. Use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) to record the audio. Set the recording mode to loopback to record the internal audio (Realtek driver might be needed).
  
  7. In the TTS input the text you want & click Generate. Stop recording when the voice is done.
  
  8. You can then select Voice Options in the toolbar & change the speed to a faster/slower speech.

  These being mixed with RVC means it generates the speech & runs the output through RVC, applying the voice model.

## StyleTTS2
***
- StyleTTS 2 aims to achieve human-level TTS synthesis only in English, It works better on full sentences, both available locally and online.
It's possible to finetune on your own dataset.
It has 2 versions:
**LJSpeech** & **LibriTTS**.

**Key Difference:**

**LJSpeech**: The dataset consists of **single-speaker** recordings, making it suitable for training TTS models with a consistent voice.
**LibriTTS**: The dataset includes **multispeaker** recordings, allowing StyleTTS 2 to adapt to different voices.

## gTTS
***
**Google Text To Speech**, the same one used in Google Translator, it has **very few voices in different languages**, kinda **robotic** and doesn‚Äôt let you choose the gender of the voice, except in the colab version where i made a function to change the pitch of it, but it isn't that great. It can be used only online (API) :

Online
- [gTTS Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nick088Official/gTTS-Google-Colab/blob/main/gTTS.ipynb)
- [gTTS Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nick088/gTTS)
- [Official gTTS Guide](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS)
- Use Google Translator
