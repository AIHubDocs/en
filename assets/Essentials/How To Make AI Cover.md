## <u>Introduction</u> üìú
:::
###### ‚Äé
   Let's guide you on making your AI cover, step by step.

   We'll divide the steps into three chapters:       

   1.  Extracting the vocals of the song.       
   2.  Getting the AI voice model.      
   3.  Converting the vocals.                

   For changing the voice into your desired person, we'll use a software called **RVC**.

   There's a lot of confusion about RVC amongst newbies, so let's break it down piece by piece & slowly.

###### ‚Äé
### :icon-chevron-down: What is RVC? 
- RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) is an advanced AI voice cloning software. It is free and <u>[open-source](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#open-source)</u>.

- It was originally designed for desktop, requiring **decent [<u>specs</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#specs)** to run it effectively.

- But can be executed through a cloud server & be used in any device, in case you don't meet the previous requirement.

- RVC has different versions (known as [<u>**forks**</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#fork)) made by the public, each one with its own features & modifications, and pros & cons, that fulfill different needs for the user.   

In order for the vocals to sound like your desired person, RVC needs a "voice model" of them.

### :icon-chevron-down: What is a Voice Model? 
- An RVC voice model is an AI model that was trained to replicate a voice & apply it to the input vocals.

- From another perspective, files that contain the information of how the voice sounds like.  
And yes, voice models are made with RVC.

- There are tons of voice models uploaded to the Internet made by the community, & you can make one yourself too. (explained later)

Now, let's start with getting the stems of the song.

## <u>Steps</u> üìù
:::
###### ‚Äé
### 1. Extract vocals.    
Have the audio file of your song ready, and let's extract the vocals from it.  

For this task you'll need an **audio isolation** software. Be sure to **clean** your sample, as they are crucial for RVC for the best & accurate results.

#### Learn more [<u>here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/uvr5--mvsep/).

### 2. Obtain voice model.
There are various methods to get one, but the easiest way is by searching in <u>[weights.gg](https://www.weights.gg)</u>.  
Click <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/voice-models--how-to-search-them/)</u> for more help & methods.     
   
**If the model doesn't exist**, you can try making it yourself. If you are interested, start <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/how-to-make-an-rvc-voice-model/)</u>.  
Though keep in mind, it won't be an instant process, it'll take some time.

### 3. Convert vocals  
With your vocals & model obtained, it's time to set up RVC and do the **[<u>inference</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#inference)**:    
‚Äé     
- #### üñ•Ô∏è <u>For local users:</u>    
   - We recommend <u>[**Mangio**](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/local/mangio-rvc/)</u>. A fork that's both simple to install & has really great features.     
‚Äé     
‚Äé     
- #### ‚òÅÔ∏è <u>For cloud users:</u>
   - We recommend <u>[**Ilaria RVC**](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/inference/ilaria-rvc/)</u>. A port of [<u>Mangio</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/local/mangio-rvc/) to <u>[Google Colab](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#google-colab)</u>, for inferencing via the cloud.

### 4. Mixing tips (extra)
Congratulations! You made it to the final part.    
Now it is time to put the pieces together & mix the song.     

You are free to use any <u>[DAW](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#daw)</u>, but we recommend FL Studio as it's one of the best beginner-friendly, free DAWs.

Start by looking up FL Studio mixing tutorials up on YouTube. It's more convenient than reading a guide for it.

**<u>Here are some recommendations for your mix:</u>**     
>‚Ä¢ Match the volume of the vocals to the same level as the original ones.      
>‚Ä¢ Add <u>[reverb](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#reverb)</u> to the vocals (not to the instrumental), to the same level as the original one.          
>‚Ä¢ Add delay if the original vocals had it.        
>‚Ä¢ Remove the very low frequencies, ranging from 20 to 100.        
>‚Ä¢ For presence and clarity, increase the high range a bit.        
>‚Ä¢ Normalize the audio.           
>‚Ä¢ Use compressor on vocals.
