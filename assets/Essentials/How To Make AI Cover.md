####  Want to learn how to make AI covers? Here's how.
:::
- To convert the the voice into your desired person, we'll use the best software for this, <U>**RVC**</u>.   

- RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) is an advanced AI software for voice cloning. It's free & open-source.

- Requires **great <u>[specs</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#specs)** to run it effectively, but it can be executed through the <u>[cloud](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cloud-based)</u> & be used in any device.

Now let's begin with the steps.

## Steps

:::
### 1. Extract vocals
- Have the audio file of your song ready, & let's extract the vocals from it. RVC is purely designed to work with voices only.

- For this, you'll need an audio isolation software. In order for RVC to bring the best results, the audio sample must be **clean**, with no undesired noises.

### 3. Convert the vocals
- After obtaining the vocals & model, it's time to set up RVC & and do <u>[***inference***](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#inference)</u>.

- There are plenty of versions of RVC, but these are the best ones for beginners.

### 4. Mixing tips (extra)
- Congratulations! You made it to the final part. Now it's time to put the pieces together & mix the song.     

- You are free to use any <u>[DAW](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#daw)</u>, but we recommend **FL Studio** or **BandLab**, as they are beginner-friendly.     
Search some of their mixing tutorials on YouTube.

- **Recommendations for the mix:**     
>• Match the volume of the vocals to the same level as the original ones.      
>• Add reverb to the vocals (not to the instrumental), to the same level as the original one.          
>• Add delay if the original vocals had it.        
>• Remove the very low frequencies, ranging from 20 to 100.        
>• For presence and clarity, increase the high range a bit.        
>• Normalize the audio.           
>• Use compressor on vocals.
