## What is a Voice Model
:::
###### ‚Äé
- ***In the field of AI***, is a program that was trained to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions.

- **In this case**, voice models are models trained to **replicate** a voice, and with AI they apply it to the input audio.

- There are plenty of them uploaded to the internet, made by the public. And the best way to make them is with the software **RVC**.    
Learn how <u>[here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/how-to-make-voice-models/).      
###### ‚Äé   
### Voice Model Files 
==- *They are made up of two files:*       
###### ‚Äé    
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>INDEX:</u>   
- Contains data regarding the voice's accent and speech manner.       
- File is additional, but usually **crucial** for the **quality** of the model.        
- While training, RVC generates two .INDEX file, but the right one will be named ``added_`` by default.         
###### ‚Äé       
##### :icon-triangle-down: <u>PTH:</u>
- This file is the model itself.
- Contains data regarding pitch.     
- While training, RVC generates other .PTHs named `D_` or `G_`, but these are training checkpoints, not usable models.

As people sometimes upload them incorrectly.

### <u>Description</u>  
:::
- This a website where people can upload voice models.
- Models uploaded in **AI Hub** & **AI Hub France** get automatically stored here too.  
- Users can read/share feedback about the models through comments & likes.

### <u>How to Search</u>  
:::
###### ‚Äé
#### 1. Log in.   
Access the website <u>[here</u>](https://weights.gg) & login by clicking the icon on the upper right corner.

!!!
If you get models from different years, remember, the person's voice changes overtime.
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 3. Evaluate the model. (optional)      
- Check the description, likes, comments, & audio sample. Feedback can help you know how great the model is.        
- The sample of the gender & vocal style according to the model gives the most accurate representation.     
- This step is specially useful if you get multiple results of the same model.

If you need a link for it, use the other methods.       
If it only exists in weights.gg, download the .ZIP & upload it to HF. Learn more <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/uploading-models-to-hugging-face/)</u>.  
###### ‚Äé  
!!! *Regarding 'epochs'.*
Epoch is a unit of measuring the training cycles of a model.        
More epochs don't equal better model. Learn more <u>[here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/).
