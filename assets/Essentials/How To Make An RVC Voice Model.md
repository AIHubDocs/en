## <u>Introduction</u> üìú

###### ‚Äé
For many, the process of making a (*decent*) voice model can get a little tedious and confusing for many.        
Let's explain the procedure piece by piece & slowly.

We'll divide the model training process into 3 chapters:      
**1.** Preparing the dataset      
**2.** Setting up RVC               
**3.** Training the model           

We'll explain as we go along.   
Let's first start by **properly** learning what a model is exactly.

### :icon-chevron-down: What is a Voice Model?
- In the field of AI, an AI model is a program that has been trained to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions.

- In this case, a voice model is an AI model that was trained to replicate a voice, and with AI it applies it to a given audio.

- The best way to make voice models is with the software **RVC**.

### :icon-chevron-down: What is RVC?
- RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) is an advanced AI voice cloning software. It is free and <u>[open-source](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#open-source)</u>.

- Originally designed for desktop, requiring decent specs and <u>[GPU](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#gpu)</u> to run it effectively.

- It can be executed through a cloud server and be used in any device, in case you don't meet the previous requirement.

- It has different versions (known as [<u>forks</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#fork)) made by the public, each one with its own features and modifications, and pros and cons, that fulfill different needs for the user.

## <u>Steps</u> üìù
:::
###### ‚Äé
### 1. Prepare dataset.
***In the context of RVC***, the dataset is an **audio** file containing the **voice** the model should replicate. It can be either a speaking or singing voice.

To get the most accurate results, having a **clean** dataset is crucial.        
So be sure to remove any undesired noises.

### 2. Set up RVC.
With your dataset ready, it's time to set up RVC. Choose the right one according to your needs.       
Begin using it once you have read the next chapter.               
‚Äé
#### :icon-device-desktop: ‚Äé <u>For local users:</u>
- We recommend [<u>**Mainline RVC**</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc/local/mainline-rvc/).     
This is the original version of RVC, being the simplest & quickest to use for training.    
‚Äé    
#### :icon-cloud: ‚Äé <u>For cloud users:</u>
- We recommend [<u>**RVC Disconnected**</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc/cloud/training/rvc-disconnected/) or [<u>**Paperspace**</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc/cloud/paperspace/).   
    - First one is a port of RVC to <u>[Google Colab](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#google-colab)</u> for training.       
    - Second one works similarly except it's much faster. A more convenient option if you don't mind paying a monthly **suscription**.

### 3. Train model.
Before you start training, there's something **important** you need to know:        
The training guides are centered around the <u>[**TensorBoard**](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/#how-to-use-tensorboard)</u>, a tool for determining exactly when to stop training.

A common mistake RVC users make is train the model for a semi-arbitrary amount of time.  
But this isn't a convenient method if you aim towards a quality model, as it can screw up the quality.

Go ahead & begin the training process, you'll be adviced when to read/set up TB.       
Have fun & be patient!
