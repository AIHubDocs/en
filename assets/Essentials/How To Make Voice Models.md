# :icon-dependabot:  How to Make Voice Models


#### - *Simple model training tutorial, using <u>[RVC](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/whats-rvc/)</u>* -
***
###### ‎ 
### 1. Prepare dataset
- ***In the context of RVC***, the dataset is an **audio** file containing the **voice** the model will replicate. It can be either speaking or singing.

- For the best results, having a **clean** dataset is crucial, so take the time to remove any undesired noises.
       
- #### <u>[Learn how</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/resources/datasets/).
***
###### ‎ 
### 2. Set up RVC
- With your dataset ready, it's time to set up RVC to train the model.   

- There are plenty of versions of RVC, but these are the **best** ones for beginners. Pick according to your needs:

    #### :icon-device-desktop: ‎ <u>[Locally](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/local/mainline/)</u>

    #### :icon-cloud: ‎ <u>[On the cloud](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/rvc-disconnected/)</u>
###### ‎
!!!warning
For local users, first ensure you meet the <u>[minimum requirements](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/whats-rvc/#what-are-the-requirements-for-rvc-locally/)</u>.
!!!
***
###### ‎ 
### 3. Train the model
- Before you start training, we inform you that the training guides are oriented around using <u>[TensorBoard](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/resources/epochs--tensorboard/#tensorboard)</u>. Read about it & install it after setting up RVC.

- Good luck & remember to be patient! As this won't be an instant process.
