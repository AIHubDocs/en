## What are Epochs?
:::     
###### â€Ž  
- "Epoch" is a unit of measuring the training cycles an AI model has gone through.      
- In other words, the amount of times the model went over its dataset and learned from it.         
â€Ž 
#### *:icon-chevron-down: How many epochs should I use for my model?*
- There isn't a way to know the right amount, as it depends on the length, quality & size of the dataset.       
Instead, use **<u>TensorBoard</u>**. This tool helps you determine **exactly** for how long you should train. (explained later)  

- A common **mistake** RVC users make is insert a specific epochs amount depending on the dataset's length, but this is **not a good method** if you want a quality model.

- Since using a semi-arbitrary number makes you prone to **underfitting** or **overtraining** your model, which negatively impacts the quality. (explained later)     
â€Ž 
#### *:icon-chevron-down: Do more epochs equal a better model?*
- It doesn't, since **overtraining** is an actual phenomenon that negatively affects the quality of a model.

## What is Overtraining?
:::
###### â€Ž       
- It's a phenomenon that ocurrs in the **AI training** field. It's when an AI model learns the dataset too well, to the point where it gets too fixated on it & begins learning undesired/unnecesesary data.  

- The model performs very well when dealing with inputs containing the dataset, but poorly on new/unseen data.     
It became too specialized on the dataset and has lost its ability to replicate anything that deviates from it.    

- This happens when the model is **trained for too long**/is too complex.

==- ***A simple analogy:***     
:icon-triangle-right: Imagine you (an AI) have an exam next month about Michael Jackson.    
â€Ž       
:icon-triangle-right: Your study content is a biography book about MJ (dataset).    
â€Ž       
:icon-triangle-right: For the next 30 days, you'll read the entire book **10 times** everyday (training time).  
â€Ž       
:icon-triangle-right: In the day of the exam, a question says "``When is Michael Jackson's birthday?``"     
â€Ž       
:icon-triangle-right: The book you read only said "``Michael Jackson was born on August 29, 1958``", so you respond the question poorly.

>Although the question was very simple, your mind became too fixated on the study content, that you can't correctly answer anything that deviates from exactly it.

Now, to avoid overtraining an RVC voice model, RVC users use a tool called ***TensorBoard***.

###### â€Ž
## What is TensorBoard?   
:::   
###### â€Ž
- The TensorBoard is a tool that allows you to visualize & measure the training of an AI model, through graphs & metrics.

- It's specially useful for determining when to stop training a voice model, since you can detect when the [<u>overtraining</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/#what-is-overtraining) point begins.    

- Because of this, the TB is the most convenient tool for RVC users for perfecting a voice model.

### :icon-chevron-down: How to Install & Open
!!!
â€¢ â€Ž This method might not work for every fork.      
â€¢ â€Ž For [<u>RVC Disconnected</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/training/rvc-disconnected/) users, ignore this, it opens up by itself when you begin training.
!!!
###### â€Ž       
- Download this file move it inside RVC's folder:       
  
    [!file](./tensorboardfiles/TensorVENV.bat)    
     
- Now execute. It will open a console window & create some folders inside RVC.    
If you get the `Windows protected your PC` issue, click <u>**More info**</u> & `Run anyway`.

- Once it's done, your default browser should open with the TensorBoard app.           

- If it doesn't, copy the address of the console at the bottom, and paste it in your browser.       
Said address will say "**https://localhost**" followed by a number.

### :icon-chevron-down: How to Use TensorBoard
  â€Ž     
    There are two ways of going over training with TB:       
- The **<u>simple</u>** guide goes over the **essentials** without going in-depth.      
Recommended for **first-timers**.

- The **<u>advanced</u>** one goes in-depth on AI training & TB. You'll actually understand how it works to clear most doubts. Ideal after having **some experience** with TB, & for making quality models on the **long-term**.        
â€Ž       
+++ Simple guide
â€Ž       
- #### <u>Setting up TB.</u>
    - Open TB & begin training in RVC.     

        If you get the ``No dashboards are active`` issue, select `SCALARS` in the top left corner dropdown.

        <img src="../tensorboard-img/17.png" alt="image" width="230" height="auto">â€Ž    
â€Ž       
    - First ensure **auto-refresh** is on, so the graphs update constantly.    

        Click the gear (:icon-gear:) in the top left corner & turn on **``Reload data``**.      
    You can always manually refresh with the refresh symbol (ðŸ”„) in the top left.  
            
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/2.png" alt="image" width="280" height="auto">
       
        â€Ž       
    - Go to the `SCALARS` tab.      
        â€Ž       
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/12.png" alt="image" width="280" height="auto">     
        â€Ž        
    - <u>In the **left panel**:</u>     
        1.â€Ž Ensure `Ignore outliners in chart scaling` is **ticked**.       
        2. Set **Smoothing** to ``0.987``.      
        3. Ensure **your model** is selected in the `Runs` section below. The models you tick will show in the graphs.      
        (untick `/eval` if you want)

***
###### â€Ž
- #### <u>Setting up graph.</u>
    - In the search bar, type "**g/total**". This will be the graph you'll monitor.        
    â€Ž   
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/19.png" alt="image" width="390" height="auto">â€Ž        

    â€Ž   
    {.list-icon}    
    - Each graph has three buttons in the corner:       
    :icon-dash: Left one is for going **fullscreen**.       
    :icon-dash: Middle one to **disable** Y axis, for a fuller view.       
    :icon-dash: And the right one is to **center** the view.      
        â€Ž      
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/15.png" alt="image" width="300" height="auto">â€Ž    
â€Ž       
    - To **zoom** in & out the graphs, press the **ALT** key + the **scroll** wheel of your mouse.     
Remember to center the view as you move around.
***
###### â€Ž       
- #### <u> Monitoring the training.</u>
    - Now let the training go for some time.  

        You'll detect **OT** (overtraining) when **g/total** hits a **lowest point** in the graph, & then stay **flat**/**rising** indefinetely.  
        â€Ž       
        **<u>Example:</u>**
        
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/10.png" alt="image" width="370" height="auto">â€Ž     
    â€Ž    
    - Don't be too anxious about if it's OT or not, the checkpoints get automatically saved either way. Run it for **longer** until it's **very clear** that it is.

    - When you detect OT, zoom in & place your mouse over the **lowest point**, & note down the ``Step`` number.
    Use the .PTH that was **closest** to **before** the OT point.   

        <img src="../tensorboard-img/8.png" alt="image" width="400" height="auto">â€Ž    

        You can now stop training.      
        To learn about the training process onwards, check the training page of your RVC in this site.
