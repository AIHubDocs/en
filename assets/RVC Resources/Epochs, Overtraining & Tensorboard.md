## Epochs
:::     
- "Epoch" is a unit of measuring the training cycles of an AI model.     

- In other words, the amount of times the model went over its <u>[dataset](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/datasets/)</u> and learned from it.         
###### â€Ž 
#### *:icon-chevron-right: How many epochs should I use for my dataset?*
- There isn't a way to know the right amount previous to training. It depends on the size, length & quality of the dataset.

- If you aim towards a quality model, it's not convenient to input a semi-arbitrary amount of epochs, as it makes it prone to underfitting/overtraining. (explained later)

- So it's best to use TensorBoard. WIth it you can determine **exactly** for how long you should train. (explained later) 
###### â€Ž 
#### *:icon-chevron-right: Do more epochs equal a better model?*
- It doesn't, since using a disproportionate amount will overtrain the model, which will affect the quality of it.

## Overtraining
:::
###### â€Ž       
- In the field of AI, is when an AI model learns its <u>[dataset](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/datasets/)</u> too well, to the point where it centers too much around it & starts replicating undesired data.

- The model performs very well with data of the dataset, but poorly with new data, as it has lost its ability to replicate anything that deviates from it.

- It happens when the model is trained for **too long**/is too complex. So to avoid this, RVC users use a tool called ***TensorBoard***.

###### â€Ž
## TensorBoard
:::   
###### â€Ž
- TensorBoard is a tool that allows you to visualize & measure the training of an AI model, through graphs & metrics.

- It's specially useful for determining when to stop training a voice model, since with it you can detect when the <u><u>[overtraining</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/#overtraining)</u> point begins.    

- Because of this, TB is the most convenient tool for RVC users for perfecting a voice model.

### :icon-chevron-down: Installing & Opening

!!!success
For <u>[RVC Disconnected</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/rvc-disconnected/) users, ignore this, it opens up by itself when you start training.
!!!

###### â€Ž       
1. Download this file & move it inside RVC's folder. Ensure the file path doesn't contain spaces/special characters.
  
    [!file](./tensorboardfiles/TensorVENV.bat)    
###### â€Ž
2. Now execute it. It will open a console window & create some folders inside RVC.    
    - If you get the `Windows protected your PC` issue, click <u>**More info**</u> & **Run anyway**.         
â€Ž   
3. Once it's done, your default browser should open with TensorBoard app.           
â€Ž  
    - If it doesn't, copy the address of the console at the bottom, and paste it in your browser.       
    Said address will say "**https://localhost**" followed by some numbers.

#### :icon-chevron-down: <u>SETTING UP</u>
***
- Open TB & begin training in RVC.     

    - If you get the ``No dashboards are active`` issue, select `SCALARS` in the top right corner dropdown.

        <img src="../tensorboard-img/17.png" alt="image" width="230" height="auto">â€Ž    
â€Ž       
- First ensure **auto-refresh** is on, so the graphs update constantly.    

    Click the gear (:icon-gear:) in the top left corner & turn on **``Reload data``**.      
    You can always manually refresh with the refresh symbol (ðŸ”„) in the top right.  
            
    <img src="../tensorboard-img/2.png" alt="image" width="280" height="auto">
       
    â€Ž       
- Go to the `SCALARS` tab.      
        â€Ž       
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/12.png" alt="image" width="280" height="auto">     
        â€Ž

#### :icon-chevron-down: <u>GRAPH</u>
***
- #### In the left panel:  
    1. Activate `Ignore outliers in chart scaling`.  

    2. Set **Smoothing** to ``0.987``.     

    3. Select your model in the `Runs` section below. The models you tick will show in the graphs. (untick `/eval` if you want)        
    â€Ž       
    <img src="../tensorboard-img/18.png" alt="image" width="240" height="auto">â€Ž      
â€Ž       
- In the search bar, type "**g/total**". This will be the graph you'll monitor.        
    â€Ž   
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/19.png" alt="image" width="390" height="auto">â€Ž        
â€Ž    
â€Ž  
- Each graph has three buttons in the corner:       
    - Left one is for going **fullscreen**.       
    - Middle one to **disable** Y axis, for a fuller view.       
    - And the right one is to **center** the view.      
        â€Ž       
        <img src="../tensorboard-img/15.png" alt="image" width="300" height="auto">â€Ž    
â€Ž       
- To **zoom** in & out the graphs, press the ALT key + mouse wheel. Remember to center the view after moving around, and after the graph updates.
***
 #### :icon-chevron-down: <u> MONITORING</u>
***
- Now let the training go for some time.  

- You'll detect **OT** (overtraining) when the graph hits the **lowest point**, then stay **flat**/**rising** indefinitely.  
    â€Ž       
     **<u>Example of OT for hours:</u>**
        
    <img src="../tensorboard-img/10.png" alt="image" width="370" height="auto">â€Ž     
    â€Ž    
- There will be various low points, one after the other, so don't get too anxious if it's OT or not. You can always use a previous checkpoint either way.

- If it reaches a low point, let it run for **longer** until it's **very clear** it's OT.

- When you detect OT, zoom in & place your mouse over the **lowest point**. Note down the ``Step`` number.

    <img src="../tensorboard-img/8.png" alt="image" width="400" height="auto">â€Ž    

- Use the model that was **closest** to ***before*** the OT point.
