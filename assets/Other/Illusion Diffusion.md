# Creating Subliminal Images Online for FREE with Hugging Face

## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to merge two images to create a subliminal message? Or perhaps you're intrigued by the idea of an illusion where a hidden image becomes visible when you blur your eyes. Look no further! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process using Hugging Face's "Input Illusion" feature.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- An image you want to hide inside another image.
- Access to Hugging Face's platform.

## Steps

1. **Upload Your Image**
   - Go to the [Illusion Diffusion Hugging Face  Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AP123/IllusionDiffusion).
   - Click on "Input Illusion."
   - Upload the image you want to hide inside another image.

2. **Adjust Illusion Strength**
   - Use the "Illusion Strength" slider.
   - Higher strength makes your subliminal message more visible.
   - Lower strength keeps it more hidden in the final output image (you'll need to blur or squint your eyes to see it).

3. **Choose a Prompt**
   - Describe the final image you want (e.g., medieval castle, flowery meadow, high quality, specific image style, etc.).

4. **Negative Prompt (Optional)**
   - Specify what the AI should NOT do when creating the image (e.g., low quality, specific styles to avoid, etc.).

5. **Click "Run"**
   - Be patient; there might be a queue.
   - If you encounter an error, try clicking again until it works.
