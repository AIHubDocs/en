## Introduction üìú
:::

- Mainline RVC is the base, original, & unmodified version of RVC. Made by the [<u>RVC-Project</u>](https://github.com/RVC-Project) team.

- It has less features compared to other [<u>forks</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/), but still has the necessary tools to do a decent job.

- It's specially liked because it's a little faster than other forks, as it's less bloated in a way. 

- Its actual name is not "Mainline", but it was given by the public to properly distinguish it from the other versions.

## How to Train üíæ
###### ‚Äé   
!!!warning <u> IMPORTANT NOTES: </u>
- For **AMD/Intel** users, preferably train through the cloud as these GPUs aren't compatible for AI training. [<u>RVC Disconnected</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc/cloud/training/rvc-disconnected/) & [<u>Paperspace</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc/cloud/paperspace/) are the best contenders.          

‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé The training process will be centered around the **Tensorboard**.       
‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé If you don't know about it, give it a quick read [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/) first.        
!!!
:::
###### ‚Äé     
:::content-center
### <u> Step 1 </u>
:::
###### ‚Äé      
#### 1. <u>Go to training area.</u>
Open RVC & head over to the `Train` tab.      
Here's the section of RVC where you set up the training process.        

<img src="../mainline-img/10.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">   

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 2. <u>Name the model.</u>
In `Enter the experiment name` you insert a name for your model.     
Don't include special characters or spaces.     


<img src="../mainline-img/11.png" alt="image" width="300" height="auto">    

‚Äé       
!!!secondary
Example: `ArianaGrande2023` and not ``Ariana Grande 2023 >.< !``.
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 3. <u>Select Target Sample Rate.</u>
In `Target sample rate` select the number that matches your datasets' [<u>sample rate</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/#sample-rate).        
Inputting an incorrect one might screw up the final quality.

‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé *If your sample rate is **44.1k**:* select ``40k``.            

‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé *If it's lower than **32k**:* select ``32k``.

### <u> Step 2a </u>
:::
###### ‚Äé  
#### 4. <u>Select dataset.</u>
In `Enter the path of the training folder` paste the [<u>path file</u>](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shift-right-click-copy-as-path.png?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5) of your dataset.

Ensure its folder name doesn't include special characters/spaces.

If there's any text in the bar, delete it beforehand.

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 5. <u>Process data.</u>
Click the `Process Data` button on the center.      

RVC will process the previous criteria for the training.   
But also the dataset file, which might take a moment depending on how big it is.

###### ‚Äé     
:::content-center
### <u> Step 2b </u>
:::
###### ‚Äé     
#### 6. <u>Select GPUs.</u>
In `Enter the GPU index(es)` determine which GPU(s) you'll use for training, by indicating the index followed by the dash (e.g: `0`).

<img src="../mainline-img/15.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 7. <u>Select pitch extraction algorithm.</u>
a. At the right select the `Pitch extraction algorithm`.       
Use either ``RMVPE_GPU`` or ``Crepe``, according to your needs.            

    Learn more [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/inference-settings/).

    <img src="../mainline-img/16.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto"> ‚Äé      

    !!! Only use one of the two, as the other algorithms are obsolete.
    !!! 
###### ‚Äé   
b. Now click the `Feature extraction` button on the right.    

    <img src="../mainline-img/17.png" alt="image" width="370" height="auto">‚Äé

    <img src="../mainline-img/b.png" alt="image" width="320" height="auto">  

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 8. <u>Create .INDEX.</u>
Press `Train feature index` at the bottom center.       
This will create the [<u>.INDEX</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/voice-models--how-to-search-them/#voice-model-files) file.

<img src="../mainline-img/i.png" alt="image" width="250" height="auto">‚Äé

***
###### ‚Äé     
:::content-center
### <u> Step 3 </u>
:::
###### ‚Äé           
#### 9. <u>Select save frequency.</u>
In `Save frequency` you determine at how many [*<u>epochs</u>*](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/) the model will saved at.       
If you are a newbie, leave it at `15`.      

- Think of it as how often RVC will make a "saving checkpoint" file of your model.     
- They're useful to resume training starting from where you left. You'll learn more later.          
- Example: with a value of ``10``, RVC will save the model at every 10 epochs (10, 20, 30, etc.)      

‚Äé   
<img src="../mainline-img/18.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 10. <u>Input epochs amount.</u>
In `Total training epochs` you determine the total amount of epochs (training cycles) for training.     

But since we'll use the Tensorboard, using an arbitrarely large value like `2000` is probably enough, to avoid re-training.

Learn more [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/).

<img src="../mainline-img/19.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 11. <u>Select batch size.</u>
`Batch size per GPU` determines the amount of data that will be processed at once while training.       

If you are a newbie leave it at ``8``.      
If your dataset is short (around 2 minutes or less), use ``4`` instead.

<img src="../mainline-img/20.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 12. <u>Launch Tensorboard.</u>
Now before you start training, open the TB.     

If you havent already, start reading [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/).
***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 13. <u>Begin training.</u>
Start training the model by clicking `Train model`.

Be sure to keep an eye on the TB & the console.

<img src="../mainline-img/21.png" alt="image" width="250" height="auto">  

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 14. <u>Stop training.</u> 
Once you detect overtraining, stop training by pressing the `Stop training` button, located at the bottom, where `Train model` used to be.

***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 15. <u>Gather model's files.</u>
a. Create a new folder anywhere named as your model.

a. Open RVC's folder, go to ``logs``, and open the folder named with the model.       
Select the `.INDEX` named ``added_`` & move it to your newly made folder.

    <img src="../mainline-img/c.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">  

‚Äé   

c. Now go to the ``weights`` folder. Here you'll find the "checkpoints", them being usable models.       

    Select the one **closest** to ***before*** the overtraining point, and move it to the new folder      

    These files will be organized with this format: **modelname_epochnumber_stepnumber.pth**   
Example: ``kalomaze_e60_s120.pth``

    <img src="../mainline-img/d.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto"> ‚Äé  
    ‚Äé            

    And that's all. Have fun with your model.

    To test the model, do a normal [<u>inference</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/how-to-make-ai-cover/) as usual.
    
    If you were going for a model that hits low/high notes, screams, or other special sounds, ensure your audio sample includes them too.
***
###### ‚Äé   
:::content-center
### <u>How to Re-Train</u>
:::
###### ‚Äé   
If the model still needed some training, you don't have to train from scratch.       
Here's how you do it.

- Simply enter the **same settings and criteria** that you previously inserted.   
Model name, sample rate, dataset, batch size, etc.        

- If you have already done it before, you don't have to press ``Process Data`` or train the [<u>.INDEX</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/voice-models--how-to-search-them/#voice-model-files) again.

- If you re-train because you didn't put enough epochs before, increase the total epochs.             
Inserting double the amount should be enough.

- Begin training again & remember to monitor the TB & console like before.
