## Introduction üìú
:::
###### ‚Äé    
- AICoverGen NO UI is a port of the AICoverGen RVC [<u>fork</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#fork) to [<u>Google Colab</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#google-colab).        
Base notebook by [<u>Ardha27</u>](https://github.com/ardha27).    

- This version (**Eddy's Version**) is an upgrade from the original Colab space, bringing bug fixes, improvements, & extra features.   
Credits to Eddy & Raid.

- It's liked for being fairly **quick**, having the necessary tools for a **great inference**, & being able to input audio through YouTube links. 

- Because of this, it's seen as one of the **best** Colab spaces for inferencing in RVC. Pretty much its only real downside is the **usage limit** for free users.

==- ***Tap to unfold*** üëà
!!! *Pros & cons are subjective to your level of experience & needs.*      
You might disagree with some of the points.        
!!!
||| **‚úîÔ∏è PROS:**       
{.list-icon}
- :icon-plus: Faster than Hugging Face.      
- :icon-plus: Automatic vocal isolation.           
- :icon-plus: Song mixing tool.            
- :icon-plus: Tool to add reverb.            
- :icon-plus: Includes Mangio-Crepe algorithm.      
- :icon-plus: Model download through links.               
- :icon-plus: Can input audio with YouTube links. 
- :icon-plus: Automatic stem separation.        
(can get each after inferencing) 
||| **‚ùå CONS:**       
{.list-icon}
- :icon-dash: 6 hour daily use limit for free users.                   
- :icon-dash: Takes 10-15 mins to load.        
- :icon-dash: UI not user-friendly for free users.  
- :icon-dash: No control over the stem separation process. Could be a problem.
- :icon-dash: Stem separation process will always run. You'll waste time if inputting already clean vocals. 
- :icon-dash: Little control of the mixing-reverb tools. Using a DAW is more convenient

#### 5. <u>Select voice model.</u>        
Under it in ``RVC_DIRNAME`` type the model's name that you have **assigned** before.

***     
###### ‚Äé   
#### 6. <u>Modify settings.</u> (optional)        
Below ``RVC_DIRNAME`` until ``Audio Mixing Options`` you'll find the [<u>inference options</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/inference-settings/).     
Tweak them accordingly for better results if you wish.

> ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé `REMIX_MIX_RATE` works like *Volume Envelope*.        
> ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé `FILTER_RADIUS` lowers the volume of breath sounds. (not supress) 
***
###### ‚Äé  
#### 7 . <u>Modify mix & reverb.</u> (optional)         

- In ``Audio Mixing Options``, you can change the values to determine the volume of main vocals, backing vocals, & instrumental.      

    <img src="../aicovergen-img/4.png" alt="image" width="240" height="auto">‚Äé                
    ‚Äé     
- In `Reverb Control`, you can add reverb to the output vocals.      
    ‚Äé

 ‚Äé      
!!! <u>Reverb Control options:</u>     
:icon-chevron-right: **REVERB_SIZE**: how "wide" the reverb sounds, like the size of a room.        
:icon-chevron-right: **REVERB_WETNESS**: volume of the reverb itself.        
:icon-chevron-right: **REVERB_DRYNESS**: volume of the vocals.       
:icon-chevron-down: **REVERB_DAMPING**: level of absorption of the reverb's *high frequencies*:       
‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Higher values yield a warmer, natural-sounding reverb.       
‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Lower values yield brighter, more present reverb.   
!!!

###### ‚Äé    
#### 8. <u>Begin the inference.</u>      
Once you are ready, execute the `Generate Cover` cell to begin the conversion.      

It'll be done when the last message says "**Cover generated at**" followed by the file path.

###### ‚Äé   
#### 9. <u>Download the output.</u>     
a. Click the folder symbol on the right. Open the `content` folder, then `FIX`, `song_output` and you'll find the output inside a folder with numbers.     

    You'll find the stems too.        
    The inferred vocals will be named with the *pitch extraction algorithm* that you chose, followed by "**mixed**" at the end.     

b. Right-click the audio, press `Download` and that's all.       

    <img src="../aicovergen-img/10.png" alt="image" width="550" height="auto">
>If you want the output without `REMIX_MIX_RATE`'s influence, use the one without "mixed" at the end.
