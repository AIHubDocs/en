## Introduction üìú
:::
- Ilaria RVC is a port of EasyGUI ([<u>Mangio</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc/local/mangio-rvc/)) to [<u>Google Colab</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#google-colab), made by Ilaria.     

- Works for inferencing only, has a pretty UI, amazing speed, & the great tools that Mangio has (such as [<u>Mangio-Crepe</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/inference-settings/#pitch-extraction-algorithm) algorithm).

- It's liked for being the fastest, free & of unlimited use way of inferencing via the cloud.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è
:::
> ***I get a red popup saying `Error`.***   
- Don't worry, it's normal. Try repeating your action.

- If the error persists, reload the Gradio page. Click `Refresh` & ensure your audio is selected in the `Choose the audio file` dropdown. 

- If it's still persisting, restart the Colab space.        
For this, go to the Colab space. At the top click `Runtime`, then `Disconnect and delete all data`, & reload the page.
***
> ***My model doesn't have a link from HF/GD.***
- Upload a **.ZIP** file of the model to Hugging Face as a **public** repo.
- If you need help, click [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/how-to-upload-models-to-hugging-face/).
***
> ***I can't download my model.***      
- This could be due to a few reasons:     

    1. **<u>Link is private</u>:** 
        - **If you uploaded to GD:** ensure the `General access` is set as `Anyone with the link`.
        - **If you uploaded to HF:** ensure the repo is set as `Public`. Learn more [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/how-to-upload-models-to-hugging-face/).            
        ‚Äé   
    2. **<u>Invalid HF link:</u>**
        - The HF link must contain the word "**.zip**".
        - If the link contains the word `blob`, replace it for `resolve` and paste it.     
    ‚Äé       
    3. **<u>Incorrect files:</u>**
        - The model must be zipped in a **.ZIP** file. Not .RAR or .7ZIP.
        - Ensure it contains the [<u>correct files</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/how-to-upload-models-to-hugging-face/).

> ***The voice glitches out. How do I fix it?***
