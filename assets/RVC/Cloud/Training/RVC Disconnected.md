## Introduction üìú
:::
###### ‚Äé              
- RVC Disconnected a port of RVC to [<u>Google Colab</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/other/glossary/#google-colab), for exclusively training.       
Notebook made by [<u>Kit Lemonfoot</u>](https://huggingface.co/Kit-Lemonfoot).

- It's free, includes all the necesary tools for a quality model, the [<u>Tensorboard</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/#what-is-tensorboard), & it's the fastest Colab space for training.    

- Making it the go-to method for training for cloud RVC users. Pretty much the only big downside is the time limit (but you can switch to another account & continue).

## How to Train üíæ
:::
###### ‚Äé 
!!! <u>Important notes:</u>
‚Ä¢ ‚Äé This guide is centered around the [<u>TensorBoard</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/). Read it first if you haven't already.    
‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Turn on [<u>third-party cookies</u>](https://cleeng.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009526800-How-to-enable-third-party-cookies-on-my-browser-), or TB might not work.
!!!
###### ‚Äé    
#### 1. <u>Prepare the dataset </u>        
a. Outside of Colab, make a folder named after your model, & place your dataset inside it. 

    Don't include spaces/special characters.     
Example: `ArianaGrande2023` and not ``Ariana Grande 2023 >.< !``.   

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/1.png" alt="image" width="210" height="auto">‚Äé                     
‚Äé       
b. Now [<u>zip</u>](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5) the folder as a `.ZIP` folder.      

    Not as .7ZIP or .RAR, as they aren't compatible with RVC Disconnected.

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/2.png" alt="image" width="210" height="auto">‚Äé           
‚Äé       
!!! <u>Reminder:</u>
With modern versions of RVC, the dataset doesn't need to be split into various audios. One audio file is enough.
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 2. <u>Set up the Colab space.</u>      
a. Head over to the [<u>Colab space</u>](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XIPCP9ken63S7M6b5ui1b36Cs17sP-NS#scrollTo=ZodNcumpg-JM).

a. Execute the ``Dependencies`` cell. This process will take a moment       

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/3.png" alt="image" width="280" height="auto">‚Äé  
‚Äé       
b. Click ``Connect to Google Drive``, select your Google account, & then ``Allow``.

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/4.png" alt="image" width="400" height="auto">‚Äé       
‚Äé       
c. Once it's done, in Google Drive go to the ``rvcDisconnected`` folder.        
Put the dataset's .ZIP inside said folder.

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/5.png" alt="image" width="335" height="auto">‚Äé    

***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 3. <u>Set Training Variables.</u>      
a. Go to the `Set Training Variables` cell.      

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/18.png" alt="image" width="335" height="auto">‚Äé   
‚Äé   
b. Define `experiment_name` as your model's name.      
    Don't include spaces/special characters.

c. Set `pretrain_type` as `original` if you aren't familiar with it.

b. Select `target_sample_rate` as your dataset's [<u>sample rate</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/#sample-rate).
    !!!
    ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé If it's **44.1k**, select ``40k``.      
    ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé If it's lower than **32k**, select ``32k``. 
    !!!
###### ‚Äé 
e. In ``pitch_extraction_algorithm`` select either ``RMVPE``, ``Crepe`` or ``Mangio-Crepe``, according to your needs.        
Don't use Harvest, as it's obsolete.           

    Learn more [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/how-to-make-an-rvc-voice-model/).

***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 4. <u>Set the enviroment.</u>      
a. Go to `Load Dataset` cell.  

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/8.png" alt="image" width="500" height="auto">‚Äé   
‚Äé  

    In the `dataset` bar type the name of the dataset's .ZIP, followed by its file extention (.zip). Then execute the cell.    
Example: `kalomaze.zip`.

    
b. Below it, execute `Preprocessing`, ``Feature Extraction``, & ``Save preprocessed dataset files to Google Drive``.

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/9.png" alt="image" width="335" height="auto">‚Äé   
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 5. <u>Train Index.</u>   
a. Run ``Index Training`` to create the [<u>.INDEX</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/voice-models--how-to-search-them/) file.      

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/17.png" alt="image" width="450" height="auto">‚Äé        
‚Äé       
b. To download it, open `rvcDisconnected` in your GD storage. Open the folder named after the model, select the .INDEX file, click the three dots & `Download`.
 
    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/13.png" alt="image" width="450" height="auto">‚Äé  
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 6. <u>Set Training.</u>       
a. Go to the `Training` cell.  

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/10.png" alt="image" width="350" height="auto">‚Äé    
‚Äé   
b. In `Save frequency` you determine at how many [<u>epochs</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/) the model will saved at.       
If you are a newbie, leave it at `15`.      

    - Think of it as how often RVC will make a "saving checkpoint" file of your model.     
    - They're useful to resume training starting from where you left. You'll learn more later.          
    - Example: with a value of ``10``, RVC will save the model at every 10 epochs (10, 20, 30, etc.)       
‚Äé         
‚Äé     
c. In `total_epochs` input the total amount of epochs (training cycles) used for the training.    

    Since we'll use a TensorBoard, using an arbitrarely large value like `2000` is probably enough, to avoid re-training. Learn more [<u>here</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/) if you haven't already.     
‚Äé   
d. Leave `batch_size` as ``8`` if you are a newbie.     
If your dataset is short (around 2 minutes or less), use ``4`` instead.    
  
 
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 7. <u>Begin training.</u>    
Now  begin training by running the `Training` cell.     
Be patient, it may take hours.

The TB will open up automatically. Remember to keep an eye on it.             
!!!warning <u>While training, you might get disconnected if you:</u>
‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Ran out of usage time.       
‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Don't interact with the space for a long time (staying AFK).     
‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Get disconnected from your Internet.       
‚Ä¢ ‚Äé Don't solve the captchas that (might) pop up ocasionally. 
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 8. <u>Download model.</u>    
a. Once you detect overtraining, to stop training click the stop button of the ``Training`` cell.     

b. Click the folder symbol on the right, open the ``Mangio-RVC-Fork`` folder, then `weights`.        
You'll find a list of each [<u>.PTH</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/essentials/voice-models--how-to-search-them/#voice-model-files) file of every epoch cycle/training step, with this format: ``modelname_epochnumber_stepnumber.pth``.        

    Right-click the right training point & press `Download`. 

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/12.png" alt="image" width="230" height="auto">‚Äé        

    And that's all. Have fun with your model.       
    
    Be sure to put the .PTH & .INDEX in a folder to keep it organized.

## How to Re-Train üîÑ
:::
###### ‚Äé  
If the model still needs training, you can resume the training from a previous checkpoint instead of starting from scratch.     
‚Äé  
#### <u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u>

1. To do this, open the Colab space, input the exact same criteria as before & execute the cells like normal, **EXCEPT** ``Preprocessing`` & ``Feature Extraction``.    
‚Äé       
2. Execute the `Load preprocessed dataset files` cell.   

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/14.png" alt="image" width="450" height="auto">‚Äé  
‚Äé       
3. Go to `Import Model from Drive to Notebook`. In `STEPCOUNT` introduce ``2333333`` & execute it.    

    <img src="../rvcdisconnected-img/16.png" alt="image" width="450" height="auto">‚Äé  
    ‚Äé       
4. And now you can resume training. Run the `Training` cell, & rememeber to keep an eye on the [<u>TB</u>](https://rvc-docs.github.io/Docs/rvc-resources/epochs-overtraining--tensorboard/#what-is-tensorboard).
