## Introduction :icon-book:
:::
- Ilaria RVC is a port of EasyGUI (<u>[Mangio</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/local/mangio/)) to <u>[Google Colab</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#google-colab). Made by <u>[Ilaria](https://ko-fi.com/ilariaowo)</u>.     

- Works for <u>[inferencing](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#inference)</u> only, has a pretty UI, huge speed, & the great tools that Mangio has (such as <u>[Mangio-Crepe](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/resources/inference-settings/#pitch-extraction-algorithm)</u> algorithm).

- And for this it's considered one of the best alternatives for doing inference through the cloud.

## TTS :icon-megaphone:
#### *`and with an RVC model`*
###### ‎
:::
1. First access the Gradio. If you don't know how, follow the first three steps of the <u>[previous chapter](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/ilaria-rvc/#inference)</u>.
***
2. Go to the `IlariaTTS` section. 

    <img src="../ilatts-img/1.png" alt="image" width="450" height="auto">‎     

    If you want, you can use the other `ElevenLabs / Google TTS`.
***
3. In `Voice` pick a voice of the gender, language & accent that you wish. Under it, insert the text.      

    If you're going to use an RVC model, pick one that sounds similar to it.
***
4. Press `Speak`. The TTS will begin to process.
***
5. Once it's done processing, there will be a playable audio in the `Final Result!` box.        
At the right press the three dots & then `Download`.         

    <img src="../ilarvc-img/8.png" alt="image" width="" height="auto">‎     
     
***
6. To use an RVC model, simply upload the output to Ilaria RVC & convert it using your model. (Optional)        
    If you don't know, learn <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/cloud/ilaria-rvc/#inference)</u>.

## Troubleshooting :icon-tools:
:::
###### ‎
==- *I get a red `Error` message.* 
###### ‎ 
- It's normal. Try repeating your action.          
‎       
- If it persists, reload the Gradio page.       
‎       
- Ensure your audio is selected in the `Choose the audio file`. If it's not in the list, click `Refresh` on its right & select it.      
‎       
- If it's still persisting, restart the Colab space:        
    - Go to the Colab space and press the downward arrow ( :icon-triangle-down: ) at the top. 
    - Click `Disconnect and delete all data`.
    - Reload the page and load RVC again.
===

==- *My model doesn't have a link from HF/GD.*
###### ‎
- You'll have to create the link yourself. Learn how <u>[here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/resources/hugging-face-upload/).
===

==- *I can't download my model.* 
###### ‎     
- This could be due to a few reasons:     

    1. **Link is private:** 
        - If it's from GD, ensure the `General access` is set as `Anyone with the link`.
        - If it's from HF, ensure the repo is set as `Public`. Learn more <u><u>[here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/resources/hugging-face-upload/)</u>.            
        ‎   
    2. **Invalid HF link:**
        - The HF link must contain the word "**.zip**".
        - If it contains the word `blob`, replace it for `resolve` & paste it.     
    ‎       
    3. **Incorrect files:**
        - The model must be zipped in a **.ZIP** file. Not .RAR or .7ZIP.
        - It must contain its correct .PTH & .INDEX files. Learn more <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/essentials/voice-models/#voice-model-files)</u>.
===

==- *The voice glitches out.*
###### ‎
- This is an anomaly called "**artifacting**". Learn how to fix it <u><u>[here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc/resources/artifacting/)</u>.
===

==- *Cannot connect to GPU backend.*
###### ‎   
- You have exhausted the <u>[GPU runtime](http://aihubdocs.github.io/en/extra/glossary/#google-colab)</u> of Colab.
===

==- *I couldn't find my answer.*
