## Introduction
:::     
- A vocal isolation app is a software designed to extract a person's vocals from an audio file, usually through the use of AI models.

- They can remove undesired noises, like background noise, reverb, echo, music, etc.    

- The goal is to get an audio sample with clean vocals, which is what RVC needs to give the most accurate & quality results.

## Ultimate Vocal Remover 5
:::
###### ‚Äé 
- UVR is a free, open-source vocal isolation app, with a convenient & simple user interface. Considered to be the best vocal isolation app by many.

- It has a great amount of AI models for extracting pretty much anything you can think of from a voice recording/song.         
           
- For these reasons, UVR is the go-to app for local RVC users, for either cleaning audio samples or datasets.

!!!warning 
*You'll requires great specs & GPU to run it effectively. Otherwise, use <u>[MVSEP](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/vocal-isolation/#mvsep)</u>*.

!!!success NOTES:
Click <u>[here</u>](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fpmi3ialjjca91.png%3Fwidth%3D1016%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D0e75311422270753ebca68fe00eaf9ce6a81218b) for a graphic explanation of the buttons. Keep in mind, the post is outdated.

If you come across a problem, read the <u>[Troubleshooting](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/vocal-isolation/#troubleshooting--)</u> chapter.
!!!
###### ‚Äé           
- ##### To extract & clean vocals from a <u>song</u>, read the `Extraction & Cleaning` guide.

- ##### For only cleaning vocals, read the `Cleaning Only` one.

+++ Extract & Cleaning üé∂  
###### ‚Äé     
#### 1. Input audio.
- Click `Select input` to select your audio/s. Or just drag the files to it.  

- In `Select output` you select in which folder you want the results to be.    

<img src="../uvrmvsep-img/4.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="auto">         ‚Äé    

!!!success 
For better results, have the audio in a <u>[lossless format](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/)</u> (**WAV** or **FLAC**), & not MP3.
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 2. Select FLAC & GPU Conversion.
a. At the right you can select the output format.       
We recommend picking `FLAC`. Learn why <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/)</u>.   

b. If your GPU is **compatible with <u>[CUDA](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cuda)</u>**, toggle `GPU Conversion` on for a faster process.    

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/16.png" alt="image" width="350" height="auto">‚Äé      
###### ‚Äé       
>This step is not mandatory, but recommended for better results.
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 3. Extract vocals. 
a. In `Process Method` select `MDX-Net`.      

b. In `Select MDX-Net Model`, select the `MDX23C` model.   

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/5.jpg" alt="image" width="250" height="auto">‚Äé      
 
b. Now click the long `Start Processing` button.  

!!!success <u>TIP:</u>
For testing models/options, I recommend ticking `Sample Mode`. This will only process 30 seconds of your sample, allowing you to test more efficiently.
!!!   
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 4. Remove reverb.   
Usually songs include reverb in the vocals. Reverb **negatively** impacts the results in RVC, so be sure to remove it.

a. Input the vocals with no instrumental.

b. In `Process Method` select `VR Architecture`, & choose the `DeEcho-DeReverb` model.        

c. Turn on `No Reverb Only` & set `Window Size` to `320`. (Optional)     
    A lower Window Size yield a higher output **quality**, but will take **longer** to process.     

d. Start processing.

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/6.png" alt="image" width="380" height="auto">‚Äé  

   
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 5. Extract lead vocals. 
Just like reverb, songs also normally include backing vocals.

a. Input the vocals with no reverb.   

b. Choose the `UVR-BVE` model.         

c. If you want the backing vocals stem, untick `Vocals only`.

d. Begin processing. And that will be all.
If you then notice background noise, run the output through the `UVR-DeNoise` model.

!!!warning For the best results, follow the pipeline explained before:       
Extract vocals -> Remove reverb -> Extract main vocals -> Remove noise

#### 3. Select model.  
a. In `Process Method` select `VR`.  

b. Set `Window Size` as ``320``. (optional)        
    Lower Window Size yield a higher output **quality**, but will take **longer** to process. 

b. Check the <u>[model list](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/vocal-isolation/#uvrs-best-models-)</u> & in `Select VR Model` pick the one according to what you need to remove.

## MVSEP
:::
###### ‚Äé      
- MVSEP is a website for audio isolation that operates just like UVR, using AI models.

- It doesn't have all the models & options that UVR has, but it has the necessary tools for getting decent-enough vocals for RVC.

- It's one of the best free cloud-based alternatives for UVR.
