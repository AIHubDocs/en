## Introduction :icon-book:
:::     
- A vocal isolation app is a software designed to extract a person's vocals from an audio file, usually through the use of AI models.

- They can remove undesired noises, like background noise, reverb, echo, music, etc.    

- The goal is to get an audio sample with clean vocals, which is what RVC needs to give the most accurate & quality results.

- For RVC users, the best app is Ultimate Vocal Remover 5 (or **UVR**). It can be used either <u>[locally](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#local-running)</u> or through the <u>[cloud](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cloud-based)</u>.

#### 1. Input audio.        
###### ‚Äé    
- Click `Select input` to select your audio/s. Or just drag the files to it.  
‚Äé   
- In `Select output` you select in which folder you want the results to be.

For better results, have the audio in a <u>[lossless format](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/)</u> (**WAV** or **FLAC**), & not MP3.
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 2. Select FLAC & GPU Conversion.
###### ‚Äé  
a. At the right you can select the output format.       
We recommend picking `FLAC`. Learn why <u>[here](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/)</u>.

b. If your GPU is **compatible with <u>[CUDA](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cuda)</u>**, toggle `GPU Conversion` on for a faster process.

###### ‚Äé  
a. In **PROCESS METHOD** select `MDX-Net`, and select the `MDX23C` model.

###### ‚Äé
#### 4. Remove reverb. 
###### ‚Äé    
- Usually songs include reverb in the vocals. Reverb **negatively** impacts the results in RVC, so be sure to remove it.

a. Input the vocals with no instrumental.       
‚Äé    
b. Select the `VR Architecture` process method, & select the `DeEcho-DeReverb` model.             
‚Äé       
c. Turn on `No Reverb Only` & set WINDOW SIZE to `320`. (Optional)     
Lower Window Size yield a higher output **quality**, but will take **longer** to process.

- Just like reverb, songs also normally include backing vocals.

a. Input the vocals with no reverb.     
‚Äé    
b. Choose the `UVR-BVE` model.          
‚Äé    
c. Begin processing. If you wish to keep the backing vocals stem, untick `Vocals only` beforehand.

+++ Troubleshooting ‚Äé :icon-tools:
:::
###### ‚Äé 
==- *A model doesn't appear.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Click the wrench (üîß) on the left & go to `Download Center`
- Select the category of the model (MDX-NET or VR)
- Unfold its dropdown & select the model that you need
- Then click the download button (üì•). The model will download, which will take a few minutes
===

==- *UVR extracted too little/too much.*
###### ‚Äé
- Modify the `Aggression Setting` value on the right. 
- This determines the depth of the extraction. Only the VR method has it.
- A higher value will deepen the extraction, and a lower one will soften it.
- Each audio is different, so you'll have to test the ideal value.
- If it didn't extract enough, we recommend to increase it by 5 with each test, until you find the right spot (10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 25, etc.)
===

==- *I can't remove some of the backing vocals.*
###### ‚Äé
- Run the audio through MDX23C or DeNoise. Modify the Aggression Setting if necessary.

!!!warning <U>IMPORTANT NOTES:</u>
Don't close the Colab tab until you're done using UVR, and don't press buttons continuously too quickly, as it may cause errors.   
As it's a port to <u>[Google Colab](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#google-colab)</u>, switch accounts if you run out of the usage time.

###### ‚Äé   
- MVSEP is a website for isolating vocals, that works similarly as UVR.

- The <u>[UVR Colab](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/vocal-isolation/#cloud-version--)</u> is much faster & convenient for this task. Use MVSEP as a last resort.     

- For free users, you can't convert audios in batches or longer than 10 minutes. If that's your case, trim it into two pieces.

==- *MVSEP extracted too much/too little.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Using the **Separation Type** of `Ultimate Vocal Remover HQ`, you can modify the `Aggressiveness` value. 
This determines the depth of the extraction.
- A higher value will deepen the extraction, and a lower one will soften it.
- Each audio is different, so you'll have to test the ideal value.
===

==- *I can't remove some of the backing vocals.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Try running the audio through MDX23C or DeNoise. Modify the Aggression Setting if necessary.
