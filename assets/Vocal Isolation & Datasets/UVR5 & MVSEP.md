## Vocal Isolation Apps
:::     
- A vocal isolation app is a software designed to extract a person's vocals from an audio file, a lot of times through the use of AI models.

- They can remove undesired noises, like background noise, reverb, echo, music, etc.    
Some models can also extract specific stems, like backing vocals, drums, bass, & more.

- The goal is to get an audio sample with clean vocals, which is what RVC needs to give the most accurate & quality results.

- The main two apps that RVC users use are [<u>Ultimate Vocal Remover 5</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/uvr5--mvsep/#ultimate-vocal-remover-5) (for **local** users) and [<u>MVSEP</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/vocal-isolation--datasets/uvr5--mvsep/#mvsep) (for **cloud** users).

## Ultimate Vocal Remover 5
:::
###### ‚Äé 
### <u>Introduction</u> üìú   
- UVR is a free, open-source vocal isolation app, with a convenient & simple user interface.        
Considered to be the best vocal isolation app by many.

- It has a great amount of AI models for extracting pretty much anything you can think of from a voice recording/song.         
           
- For these reasons, UVR is the go-to app for local RVC users, for either cleaning audio samples or datasets.

!!!warning *Just like with RVC, you'll need decent specs and GPU to run it smoothly.*

###### ‚Äé           
Depending on if you want to extract & clean vocals of a song from **scratch**, or if you only need to **clean** an already existing sample, the procedure is a little different:  

+++ Extract & Clean Vocals From Song üé∂  
###### ‚Äé     
#### 1. <u>Input audio.</u>  
Click `Select input` to select your audio/s.     
Or just drag the audios to it.  

In `Select ouput` you select in which folder you want the results to be.    

<img src="../uvrmvsep-img/4.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="auto">         ‚Äé    

!!!success 
For better results, have the audio in a [<u>lossless format</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/) (**WAV** or **FLAC**), & not MP3.
!!!
***
###### ‚Äé 
#### 2. <u>Select FLAC & GPU Conversion.</u> 
a. At the right you'll see three audio formats to pick as the output format.       
We recommend picking `FLAC`. Learn why [<u>here</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/rvc-resources/audio-formats--sample-rate/).   

b. If your GPU is **compatible with [<u>CUDA</u>](https://aihubdocs.github.io/en/other/glossary/#cuda)**, toggle `GPU Conversion` on for a faster process.    

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/16.png" alt="image" width="350" height="auto">‚Äé      
###### ‚Äé       
>This step is not mandatory but recommended for better results.
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 3. <u>Remove instrumental.</u> 
a. In `Process Method` select `MDX-Net`.        
In `Select MDX-Net Model`, select the `MDX23C` model.   

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/5.jpg" alt="image" width="250" height="auto">‚Äé      
 
    !!!info *If the model isn't installed.*
    Click the wrench (üîß) on the left, go to `Download Center`, select `MDX-Net`, select said model & click the download symbol (üì•). Here's where you install models for UVR.
    !!!
###### ‚Äé   
b. Now click the long `Start Processing` button.        
‚Äé     
!!!success <u>TIPS:</u>
If you extracted too much/too little, modify the `Aggression Setting` to determine the **depth** of the extraction, until you find the sweet spot:      
    ‚Ä¢ **Lower** values **softens** the extraction.   
    ‚Ä¢ **Higher** values **deepens** it.     
‚Äé       
For testing models/aggression settings, I recommend activating `Sample Mode`.       
This will process only `30` seconds of the sample, allowing you to test more efficiently.
!!!     
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 4. <u>Remove reverb.</u>    
Usually songs include reverb to the vocals. If you leave it in, it will **negatively** impact the results in RVC.  
If yours don't have ANY, you can skip this step. 
a. Select the vocals with no instrumental as input.

b. In `Process Method`, select `VR Architecture`, & choose `DeEcho-DeReverb` model.        

c. Turn on `No Reverb Only` & set `Window Size` to `320`. (Optional)     
        ‚Ä¢ Lower Window Size yield a higher output **quality**, but will take **longer** to process.      
d. Start processing.

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/6.png" alt="image" width="380" height="auto">‚Äé  

   
***
###### ‚Äé
#### 5. <u>Remove backing vocals.</u> 
Just like reverb, songs also normally include backing vocals.
Skip this step if yours don't any.

a. Input the vocals with no reverb.   

b. In `Process Method`, select `VR Architecture` & choose the `UVR-BVE` model.         

c. Set `Window Size` to `320`. (Optional)     
A lower Window Size yield a higher output **quality**, but will take longer to process. 

d. To get the backing vocals stem, ensure `Vocals Only` is deselected.

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/17.png" alt="image" width="230" height="auto">

‚Äé            
And that will be all. If they're all clean you're good to go & use it in RVC.    
!!!warning For the best results, follow the pipeline explained before:       
First, remove instrumental. Second, reverb. Third, backing vocals

b. At the center select `Window Size` as ``320``. (optional)        
Lower Window Size yield a higher output **quality**, but will take **longer** to process. 

b. In `Select VR Model`, select a model according to what you need to remove:     

    - For **noise**: `UVR-DeNoise`. Make sure to tick `No Noise only`.      

    - For **reverb**: `DeEcho-DeReverb`. Make sure to tick `No Reverb Only`.       

    - For **overlapping voices**, `UVR-BVE`. To get the backing vocals stem, ensure `Vocals Only` is deselected.

‚Äé
